3D Character Modeling and Topology Optimization (Blender)

Sculpted and rebuilt the topology of a human model's head, and neck using Blender’s polybuild tool, ensuring accurate muscle flow and edge loop placement for optimal deformation.
Applied Blender’s mirror modifier to maintain symmetry and streamlined the process by modeling only half of the character with a central symmetry axis.
Focused on proper edge flow for key facial features, including neck muscles, face contour, eye lines, and mouth definition, ensuring minimal triangles and correct placement of edge poles (cheekbones, jaw, behind ears).
Assigned distinct color materials to highlight contours and demonstrate detailed topology work, following industry-standard practices for facial and muscle structure modeling.
